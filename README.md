# Hello stranger! I'm @pgomezponce

👋 Hi, I’m @pgomezponce. I'm an Interaction Designer, I'm facing some Front-end developer challenges and I'm interested on Data Science.

🌱 I’m currently learning React Native, so we may build solutions for _almost_ everyone.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on remote projects related to education, data collection and end-to-end challenges (concept to deployment).
